I've been working as an architect in a small company that was engaged in managing video assets in the web and had huge ambitions. For a few years we became partners with all Israeli media moguls such as the Ynet, Maariv, Walla, TheMarker, Yellow pages and so on.

It was a very interesting and challenging time, especially since the whole system was designed and developed from scratch and I got my first C-level managerial expirience.
