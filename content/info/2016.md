It was a time of American TV shows and very hard work. Distributed development teams and local units took all the time.
In very short time we created a sophisticated voting system for an ultra-large-scale application that can handle 30
million simultaneous connections at a speed of up to 3 million requests per second. The system performed in US, Brazil,
Argentina, Portugal, Indonesia, Israel and Russia.

I was also excited to have collaborated with ABC, Disney, Univision and Fusion.
