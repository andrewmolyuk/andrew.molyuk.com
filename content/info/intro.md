I am the father of a gang of four, a happy husband, a hands-on development manager, an experienced software architect, a principal coder, a skilled devops and technology guru. Iâ€™m not only used to  wearing those many hats, I sincerely enjoy it.

I have many years of experience leading teams and companies to success.
