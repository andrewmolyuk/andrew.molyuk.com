Welcome to my blog! This is my first post, aptly titled "Hello World". This phrase has a long history in the world of
programming, often serving as the first output of a new programmer learning a language. It's a simple, yet powerful
statement - a greeting to the world of code.

In this blog, I'll be exploring various topics related to software development, from the basics of programming languages
to the complexities of system design. I'll share insights from my own experiences, discuss new trends and technologies,
and hopefully provide valuable content for both beginners and experienced developers alike.

In particular, this post has been instrumental in shaping the blog section of the
[hugo-porto](https://github.com/hugo-porto/theme) theme for Hugo.

## My first experience writing a theme for Hugo

When I first decided to write a theme for Hugo, I was both excited and a bit apprehensive. I had some experience with
web development, but creating a theme from scratch was a new challenge.

The first step was to understand the structure of a Hugo theme. Hugo's documentation was a great help in this regard,
providing clear and detailed explanations. I learned a lot about the importance of the `layouts` directory, the role of
`partials`, and how to use `shortcodes` for reusable components.

The actual coding process was a mix of trial and error, learning, and satisfaction. I faced challenges, like figuring
out how to make the theme responsive and ensuring it looked good on different screen sizes. But with each problem
solved, I gained more confidence and knowledge.

One of the most rewarding parts was seeing the theme come to life. After hours of coding, it was thrilling to see my
design rendered in the browser. It was also gratifying to receive positive feedback from the Hugo community.

In conclusion, writing a theme for Hugo was a rewarding experience that taught me a lot about web development and
design. It was a journey filled with challenges, learning, and ultimately, satisfaction.

To demonstrate and test the code highlighting feature, I'd like to show here are a few examples of "Hello World" in
different programming languages:

## Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## Python

```py
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Javascript

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

## Bash

```sh
echo "Hello, World!"
```

## C&sharp;

```c
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

## C++

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello, World!";
  return 0;
}
```

So, to all my readers, I echo that timeless phrase - Hello, world! Stay tuned for more posts, and happy coding!
