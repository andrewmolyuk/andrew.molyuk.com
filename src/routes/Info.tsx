            I am the father of a gang of four, a happy husband, a hands-on
            development manager, an experienced software architect, a principal
            coder, a skilled devops and technology guru. Iâ€™m not only used to
            wearing those many hats, I sincerely enjoy it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have many years of experience leading teams and companies to
            success.

          <p>
            I joined a mid level Israeli company as developer in database
            management team to help shape the data and replication processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a very challenging time to work immediatelly after emigrating
            to sunny Israel, but it was offset by acquaintance with so many
            professionals who accompany me to this day.

            First steps in complex financial systems, telecom solutions and
            involvement in design and development of huge web platform using
            data science to improve oncology care in children's departments.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got a very humane experience, we participated in the system
            deployment and configuration in hospitals and closely communicated
            with both doctors and children.

            I've been working as an architect in a small company that was
            engaged in managing video assets in the web and had huge ambitions.
            For a few years we became partners with all Israeli media moguls
            such as the Ynet, Maariv, Walla, TheMarker, Yellow pages and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a very interesting and challenging time, especially since the
            whole system was designed and developed from scratch and I got my
            first C-level managerial expirience.

            It was a time of American TV shows and very hard work. Distributed
            development teams and local units took all the time. In very short
            time we created a sophisticated voting system for an
            ultra-large-scale application that can handle 30 million
            simultaneous connections at a speed of up to 3 million requests per
            second. The system performed in US, Brazil, Argentina, Portugal,
            Indonesia, Israel and Russia.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also excited to have collaborated with ABC, Disney, Univision
            and Fusion.

            I deeply entered the world of video ads and arbitration. Fully
            remote development team, about 23 billion aggregated events daily,
            complicated hiring process, 300 million database entries updated
            daily, complex decision-making algorithms, more than 250
            automatically scalable computing units at peak load and effective
            business processes automation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coronola time, quarantine, working from home, new challenges and a
            lot of fun everyday.
