                        <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">I immersed myself deeply
                            in the realm of video ads and arbitration, leading a fully remote development team. We
                            handled an impressive volume of approximately in 23 billion aggregated events each day and
                            updated around 300 million entries in our database daily. Operating complex
                            decision-making algorithms, we managed over 250 automatically scalable computing units
                            during peak loads while effectively automating business processes.

                        <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">During the challenging
                            times of the coronavirus pandemic and quarantine, we adapted to working from home,
                            encountering new obstacles and finding joy in overcoming them daily.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">On a personal note, my
                            son's wedding took place in Prague, and it was a truly joyous occasion for my family.
                            Witnessing my son and his wife's happiness brought me immense joy.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Unfortunately, shortly
                            after the wedding, the war in Ukraine broke out. As a result, we had to discontinue
                            collaboration with Belarus and relocated our R&D center to the picturesque country of
                            Georgia. This transition proved to be both delicate and fascinating, providing valuable
                            experiences for me and my team.</p>

                            were filled with American TV shows and relentless hard work. Balancing distributed
                            development teams and local units consumed most of my time.

                            we managed to develop a sophisticated voting system for an ultra-large-scale application.
                            This robust system had the capability to handle a staggering 30 million simultaneous
                            connections, processing up to 3 million requests per second. We successfully deployed this
                            system across various countries, including the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Portugal,
                            Indonesia, Israel, and Russia.

                        <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">I felt a surge of excitement
                            when I had the opportunity to collaborate with renowned entities such as ABC, Disney,
                            Univision, and Fusion. It was a privilege to contribute to projects involving these esteemed
                            organizations.

                            management. During this time, we forged partnerships with prominent Israeli media giants,
                            including Ynet, Maariv, Walla, TheMarker, Yellow pages, and others. We also collaborated
                            with a number of international companies, including the BBC, The New York Times, and The

                        <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">The experience proved to be
                            highly engaging and filled with challenges, particularly due to the fact that we built the
                            entire system from the ground up. This endeavor provided me with my first taste of C-level
                            managerial responsibilities, which added an extra layer of growth and learning to my
                            professional journey.

                        <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">During this period, I gained a

                            doctors and the bravery displayed by the young patients served as a constant reminder of the
                            significance of our work. It reinforced my commitment to leveraging technology and
                            innovative solutions to make a positive difference in the lives of those in need. These
