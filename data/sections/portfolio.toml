title = "mongo-leader"
description = "Mongo Leader is a Node.js package for leader election backed by MongoDB. It is inspired by the redis-leader library. The main class Leader extends the Node.js EventEmmiter class, allowing instances to emit events when they gain or lose leadership status. This makes it a powerful tool for managing distributed systems where only one instance should be in control at any given time."
